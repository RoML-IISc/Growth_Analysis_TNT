# Growth Analysis of Titanium Nanotubes on various parameters

## Introduction
Titanium Nanotubes have their major application in biomedical implants due to biocompatibility of Ti in the body. The analysis of the properties of Nanotubes become crucial since the Nanotubes increase the surface area by large extent, thus enhancing the catalytic and  reactive properties. Specially in biomedical implants the TNTs enhance the tissue attachment process due to the presence of the nano-scale surface characteristics. one-dimensional nanostructure-like nanotubes can exhibit large internal and external surfaces along with a surface in their vertex and a surface in the interlayer regions. Among the various nanostructured oxide materials, special attention has been directed to TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) due to its enhanced properties, cost-effective construction, and higher surface-to-volume ratio.

## Experimental Conditions
-Electrolyte with 0.3M H3PO4 and 0.3M NH4 was used at normal room temperature pressure conditions.
-First setup had Titanium sheets rolled into a cylindrical shape of diameter 8 mm and kept in form using electrical tape.
-Carbon electrode were held in position between the sheet via DST to maintain a uniform distance from the walls of the sheet.
-Second setup had Titanium rectangular sheets of 12.6mm, 4mm away from the carbon electrode from the centre of the sheet.
-The setups were run for 2 varying input parameters : Voltage, Anodization time.
-Voltage setups were run for incremental voltages of 10 V, 20 V, 30 V.
-Anodization time for each of the voltages were 1 hour, 2 hour and 3 hours.
